# 250-Projects

I interpret user needs and implement them into a program by identifying the stakeholders and defining user needs. User stories help with this by giving a user-centered approach and prioritization and focus. User stories are typically prioritized based on their importance and impact on users. When developing a program, I first approach the task by making sure I understand what needs to be done, gathering the requirements needs, and testing my program. An agile process I hope to incorporate into my future development work is Scrum. Scrum will allow me to break the development process into small, time-boxed iterations which are known as sprints. To be a good member of software development you must be a good communicator, be a continuous learner, and be able to adapt to any situation.
